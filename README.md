# Automatic World Backup script for OBS

The idea is simple. You select on which action should the script activate (On Stream Stop/On Recording Stop). When that action is triggered, the script basically takes the specified World files and parses them into a .zip archive, which then will be placed into a folder named after your world in the specified backups folder of your choice.

For the ones who say `"ew, it's written in python"` stfu, it's either python or lua.
